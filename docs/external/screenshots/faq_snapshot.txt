  uid=5_188 StaticText "Absolutely! While gym workouts build muscle strength and cardiovascular fitness, yoga improves flexibility, balance, posture, and mental well-being. They complement each other perfectly."
  uid=5_189 StaticText "Many gym-goers find yoga helps prevent injuries, improves recovery time, and enhances overall performance. Plus, yoga addresses stress and mental health—benefits that gym workouts alone cannot provide. Think of gym as building your house, and yoga as creating a home."

  uid=5_198 StaticText "Each batch runs 3 days per week, giving you 12 classes per month. Choose the schedule that fits your routine. Many working professionals prefer our morning batches to start the day energized, or evening batches to unwind after work."
  uid=5_199 button "How many classes do you take? ›"
  uid=5_200 StaticText "Each batch gets 3 classes per week, totaling 12 classes per month."
  uid=5_201 StaticText "This frequency is intentionally designed for the Iyengar method, where we hold poses longer and focus intensely on alignment. Your body needs adequate rest between sessions to integrate the practice and build strength safely. Consistent 3x/week attendance shows better results than sporadic daily practice."
  uid=5_202 button "I have a chronic ailment, can I do yoga? ›"
  uid=5_203 StaticText "Yes, you absolutely should! However, chronic conditions require personalized attention rather than jumping into group classes."
  uid=5_204 StaticText "We strongly recommend coming in for a free assessment where we'll:"
  uid=5_205 StaticText "Evaluate your specific condition"
  uid=5_206 StaticText "Test your current flexibility and range of motion"
  uid=5_207 StaticText "Understand your pain triggers and limitations"
  uid=5_208 StaticText "Based on this assessment, we'll determine whether you're suited for our regular batches or would benefit more from one-to-one therapy sessions.

  uid=5_220 StaticText "With yoga, you don't just work on fixing the pain—you fix the ROOT CAUSES: postural habits, structural misalignments, and muscle imbalances. This comprehensive approach leads to lasting relief, not temporary band-aids. Think long-term transformation, not short-term fixes."
