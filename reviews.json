I initially tried physiotherapy, which focused only on my shoulder, but my real transformation began when I joined Yog Chumbak in July 2024.\n\nThrough dedicated one-on-one therapy, I not only regained mobility but also discovered the power of holistic healing & its deeper dimensions. In just four months, I progressed to the Care Batch, and by February 2025, I had recovered 80%. Unlike physiotherapy, yoga strengthened my entire body, bringing balance and well-being beyond just recovery.\n\nI am deeply grateful to Yog Chumbak for guiding me on this journey. It's more than just healing—it's a way of life.\nYoga illuminated the whole landscape, strengthening not just my shoulder, but every aspect of my being."

As I am suffering from fibromyalgia, I have severe pains in several parts of my body. Then  somebody in my known told me about yog chumbak. First day I visited there and give up by saying I can't go there it is far from my home. But my husband convinced me to take trial session. I really went there by a mood to get it reject. But taking just one session changes my mind. And I have joined Yog Chumbak. This Iyengar Yoga really helps me. After taking few sessions I am writing this review. Now I am in a stage where I can think my life without pains. It really helps me a lot. Now when I think of that old days, I just laugh on myself when I agreed my life with pains. Now if someone says \"I can't do yoga or I don't have time or anything bla.... bla... bla....\"   Then I just says to them that you don't love your self. If you love yourself and wants to live without pains then you can join Iyengar yoga. Iyengar Yoga is a form of yoga which can be done with the help of props. So it is very easy to do yoga for those persons who is in pains.\nI really appreciate the efforts done by Yog Chumbak management. There is an individual attention to everyone here.\nOne more thing I would like to share that I didn't drink water from last 35-36 years. I always drink pepsi instead of water. Daily consumption of my pepsi is about 2.5 litres. But after joining Yog Chumbak, the management here helps me to drink water daily. Although I haven't stopped drinking pepsi. But I have started drinking water 1 or 2 glasses daily.\nMy heartiest Thanks to Yog Chumbak to change my life😊"

At 40 years old and struggling with weight, sciatica, varicose veins, diabetes, and migraine, I was advised to incorporate exercise into my routine. Joining Yog Chumbak 2.5 months ago was a turning point. Here at Yog Chumbak, i discovered my knock knees, which was causing imbalance in my body. Since then, I've seen remarkable improvements in my health.\n\nBefore YogChumbak, my health was a constant struggle. Even after joining, initially  I struggled with basic asanas even with props,  but now I can perform them with ease with just twice a week classes. Ever since Covid happened, my health deteriorated a lot. Now, in such a short span of time of less than 3 months of consistent yoga classes, i recently achieved a milestone of walking 11,085 steps without any pain, something I couldn't imagine before.\n\nI could have joined many yoga institutes for enjoyment, like those often showcased on social media. However, I chose Yog Chumbak not for enjoyment but for my health. There are plenty of places for enjoyment, but for me, health and wellness were the top priorities. Yog Chumbak has not only transformed my body but also rejuvenated my spirit. I wake up each day feeling refreshed and grateful for this newfound energy and health, all thanks to YogChumbak."
